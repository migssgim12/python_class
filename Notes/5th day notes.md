####Increment Operator and String Building
Increment operator - # +=
counter - 0 # Initialize the counter  
||||  
counter += 1 # Click.  
print(counter)
*1  
counter += 3 # Add three more    
message = ''  
message += '11'  
#####Inline Variable assignment  
a=1  
b=7  
a, b, c, d, e = (1, 7, 3,  6, 5) #tuple  
print (a, b, c, d, e)  
*1 7 3 6 5  
#####Unpacking iterables with 
sneakers- ('vans', 'nike', 'asics', 'brooks', 'new balance') # This is a tuple  
sneakers[0:2]  
('vans', 'nike')  
(llamas, dog, cat, *rest_of_shoes) = sneakers #unpacking step  
print(llamas)  
print(dog)  
print(cat)  
print(rest_of_shoes)
vans  
nike  
asics  
['brooks, 'new balance'] 
 cars = 
cars = ['honda', 'jaguar', 'lemon']
cars =[::-1] # Reverse
cars = cars +['deloean'] # This will put it on the end of the list
cars * 3  
cars.append(['volcano', 'california','maguro'])  
cars will be a list, but then a list within a list
for car in cars:
	print(car)
cars[-1.].extend(['avocado', 'cucumber'])  
board = [[0,0,0],  
        [0,0,0],  
        [0,0,0]]  
board[1][1] = x  
board[0][2] = 0  
for row in board:
    print (row, end='\n')  

people[1][0][1][3] - #these

####How to study 
Create flash cards, methods  
then use the operators - and use methods with the operators  
list methods and use the operators with the key words and built in functions
